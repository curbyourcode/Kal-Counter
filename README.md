# Meal-Tracker Angular 7

####  Responsive application allows users to track meals and calorie intake

## Description

A remake of a project that I created with the release of Angular 2 in 2016. This version is done in Angular 7 with heavy focus on Angular Material. Users are able to log their daily meals, including details pertaning to thier meal. You may assume foods being logged are for a single day (you are not required to keep track of multiple days' meals).

* Run `npm install` to install packages.
